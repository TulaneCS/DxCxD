### Overview

We are happy to invite you to a one-day workshop entitled “Data by Community by Design” (DXCXD) focused on the intersection of data, community, and design at Tulane University and the greater New Orleans Community that will:

1. Provide in-person networking opportunities with groups on campus and from the greater New Orleans community to showcase current initiatives that use data and design to improve their community.
2. Participate in an in-person workshop to brainstorm ideas, articulate opportunities, and identify issues on the horizon that can be addressed through the use of data, community, and design.
3. Create new linkages between participants and spark ongoing dialogue for improving our community.

Participants will include members of the broader New Orleans community including non-profits, government, and businesses as well as students, faculty, and staff from Tulane.
